# AFUP's code of conduct

AFUP is an organization dedicated to networking and collaboration in the PHP developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the PHP community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the organization events and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by AFUP or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any AFUP event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

## Guidance

### Versions

This code of conduct is versioned through GitHub's convenience.

As the code of conduct should be updated for each new event (i.e. Emergency contacts), a tag on the last valid commit for this event should be created. The tag may be added after the event took place. Although there's no official syntax for those, a tag should be explicit.
